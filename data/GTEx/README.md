# GTEx data

* Bulk RNA-seq data (gene read counts and gene TPMs) for each tissue was
  downloaded from the [GTEx
  portal](https://gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/bulk_tissue_expression#bulk_tissue_expression-gtex_analysis_v8-rna-seq) [1].

* Single-tissue eQTL data were downloaded from the [GTEx
  portal](https://gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/qtl#qtl-gtex_analysis_v8-single-tissue_cis-qtl_data)
