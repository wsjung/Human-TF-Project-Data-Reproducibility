# MONET modules
===============

List of modules identified by the MONET toolbox [1].

Filenames are formatted as "<network><algorithm>.txt", e.g. metanettop250k1.txt
are the modules identified by using the K1 algorithm on the top avg 250 targets
per TF subnetwork of the whole blood METANet. Similarly, TSpandam1directed.txt
are modules identified applying the M1 (directed) algorithm on the whole blood
tissue-specific PANDA network.
